update the lift system to support multiple Lifts like lets say 4 Lifts are available each running on different threads. 
different lift is allocated to each request based on nearest and feasible resources. The nearest lift is assigned to each request. 
The request's response would be the lift number assigned to request. here requests assigned are mainly the outside requests, 
as internal requests would be alloted to the same lift. Continuously display each lift's state .




Create a Lift Manager:

This will manage all the Lifts.
It will determine which lift should serve a request based on proximity and direction.
Update the Lift System:

Each lift will now also have an identifier (LiftID).
The display function will now also show the LiftID along with its current status.
Update the Handlers:

The response will now also include the LiftID that has been assigned to serve the request.
